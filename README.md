**By using the script you agree to the following:**
1. Any act to deobfuscate, tamper, modify, dump, the contents of the script or API requests are not allowed. There is tamper detection in place.
2. Requesting a Discord invite will require the script to access the following:
    * Your ROBLOX Username/ID
    * A HASHED version of your IP address^
    * A HASHED version of your Exploit HWID^
    * The game you are in (Used for debugging)
    * THe script version you are using (Used for debugging)
3. Any attempt to bypass the security in place is not allowed.
4. Any act of abuse towards Eclipse API is not allowed. (This means spamming requests, trying to decrypt sensitive information)
5. If joining the Discord server, you must follow the [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [Discord ToS](https://discord.com/terms).
6. If you fail to follow any of the discord server rules, you will be punished accordingly.
7. If your script version is shut down/closed, you cannot try to force it to function. This also applies to older, less secure versions.
8. This script is **not** meant to be compatible with other scripts. Bug reports of the script while another script is running will be voided.

If you agree to all of the above, then you are free to use the script.
Failure to follow the Terms of Service will result in a blacklist/ban from using the script and any other script developed by Eclipse.

^This information will be hashed, so it cannot be decrypted or read raw by the developers. This helps protect your sensitive data while providing the same security and functionallity as it normally would. If your exploit does not hash your HWID by default, your regular HWID will be sent instead, but hashed when it reaches the server.
